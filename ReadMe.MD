# Scroll Compressor/Supercharger/Expander Geometric Analysis:
# ========================================

## A Volkswagon "G-Ladder" Scroll Supercharger geometry is analyzed for detail scroll geometry variation with rotation angle. As output, a NASTRAN BDF file is created, coordinate and minimum scroll rotor distances are calculated for the purpose of supporting detailed compressor/expander thermodynamic performance in a variety of compressor/expander applications.
